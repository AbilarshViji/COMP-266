        <h1>Troubleshooting Guide</h1>
        <p>So your PC doesnt work. Heres some quick things you can check before determining if a part is dead.</p>
        <h2>Check the PSU is on</h2>
        <p>Ensure that the PSU switch is on. On is I, and off is O.</p>
        <h2>Check your power connections</h2>
        <p>It is possible that one of your connections may be loose. Double check that all your power connectors are seated correctly. </p>
        <h2>Check that the RAM is properly seated</h2>
        <p>The RAM should click in. Check that all the RAM sticks are level to each other. If one is slightly higher then the others, then it is not seated properly. Try either pushing on it, or removing and reinstalling it.</p>
        <h2>Power supply underrated</h2>
        <p>It is possible that you picked a power supply that cannot supply enough power for your system. Use the power supply calculator below to see if your power supply is sufficient</p>
