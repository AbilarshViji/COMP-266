        <h1>Upgrade Guide</h1>
        <h2>CPU</h2>
        <p>CPUs can be upgraded. They might however require a motherboard change depending on the compatibility of your current motherboard. See the <a href="compatible.html"><span id="link">compatibility</span></a> page to confirm if your CPU would be compatible.</p>
        <h2>RAM</h2>
        <p>RAM can be easily swapped out, as it is just 2 clips holding the RAM in and it is easily accessible. One thing to look out for is compatibility. Try to get the same kit of RAM you already have to ensure they work together.</p>

        <h2>Storage</h2>
        <p>Adding a SATA drive is as simple as mounting the drive to your case, and connecting a power cable to the PSU, and data cable to the motherboard. M.2 drives require a bit more effort as you need to find the port on the motherboard for M.2 drives,
            and connect it to the motherboard. The M.2 port may be inaccessible do to your graphics card or CPU cooler and might require partial disassembly to access.</p>
        <h2>GPU (Graphics Card)</h2>
        <p>Graphics cards are fair simple to upgrade. You just remove the old one and install a new one. One thing to make sure is that the power supply can support the new GPU. Use the <a href="troubleshootGuide.html"><span id="link">power supply calculator</span></a>            to ensure that the power supply has enough power for the GPU.</p>
        <h2>Power Supply</h2>
        <p>Upgrading a PSU requires you to remove all the existing power connections (motherboard, gpu, storage), remove the old PSU in the case, and install the new one. Make sure that you do not mix cables from the old power supply with the new one, as
            the pinouts on the power supply side maybe different.</p>
