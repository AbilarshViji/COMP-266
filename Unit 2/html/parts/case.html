        <p>The case is what will hold all the components for your PC. There are many factors to consider when deciding what case to get. The first thing you should look at is the size of the case you want. There are 3 standards for case sizes which are Mini-ITX,
            mATX, and ATX from smallest to largest. These sizes are based on the size of the motherboard. Smaller cases may use a SFX power supply, which is a different physical size then a standard ATX power supply.<br><br>Another factor to consider
            for cases is how many storage drives you need to fit in the computer. There are limited mounts for drive in the case so keep this in mind. Modern cases also omit 5.25" bays, which are typically used for optical drives, as no one uses optical
            drives anymore.</p>
