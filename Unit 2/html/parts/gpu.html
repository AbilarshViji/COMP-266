    <p>The GPU or graphics processing unit is used for anything graphics related on the computer. There are 2 manufacturers for GPUs: NVIDIA, and AMD. The simplest way to purchase one buy the highest model which you can currently afford. Graphics cards are
        typically air cooled. Witin a certain SKU, such as RTX 3060 Ti, there might be many different versions from different OEMs. The difference between the different SKUs are minimal, but may include different level of components such as capacitors
        and power delivery, higher binned GPUs which may overclock better, different cooler designs which can provide better cooling, and higher levels of factory provided overclocks.</p>
