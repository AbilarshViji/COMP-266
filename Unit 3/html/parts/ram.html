        <p>RAM is used as short term memory for the computer. RAM is consider volatile memory, which means that it will be deleted on system power off. RAM is used for storing any active programs that are running on the computer. The more RAM you have, the
            more applications you can have running simultaneously. Currently the standard for RAM is DDR4. The DDR standard determines the number of pins is on the RAM, as well as the voltage the RAM runs at. RAM also has a frequency in addition to the
            capacity. The frequency is becoming more important to the speed of the computer. Typically 3200MHz is considered a good sweet spot for RAM speed.</p>
