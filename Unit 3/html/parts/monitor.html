        <p>The monitor is where everything from the computer is displayed. Some people may overlook a monitor, and just buy the cheapest one available. There are however many things to consider when purchasing a monitor. First, there is the size and resolution
            you would like. This will determine how much of your field of view you want taken up by the monitor, and how much information you would like the monitor to display. <br><br>Next is the refresh rate of the monitor. This determines how many
            times a second the monitor refreshes. The higher the refresh rate, the smoother the video will be on the computer. <br><br>Finally, there is the panel type of the monitor. The panel type determines how much of the colour spectrum the monitor
            can display, the input latency of the monitor, and the viewing angles of the monitor.</p>
