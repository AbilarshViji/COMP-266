        <h1>What to use your PC for</h1>
        <p>PCs unlike consoles allow you to do much more then just game. They can be used for your general computing needs as well as for more specialized use-cases.</p>
        <h2>CAD (Computer Aided Design)</h2>
        <p>CAD systems benefit from a better computer overall. Having good single-core performance, a fast GPU, and large amounts of RAM for larger models are all beneficial for an improved experience using CAD software. Rendering with CAD software will
            benefit greatly from having multiple cores, as well as a GPU so increase render speeds. An SSD also always good for a system to load up the large CAD software, as well as CAD models up quickly.</p>
        <h2>Photo/Video Editing</h2>
        <p>Photo and video editing software benefits from many cores on a CPU, as well as RAM for larger projects. Storage is also a big part of editing media, as the files you will be working with can be quite large. It is good to have multiple/larger SSDs
            for to hold many projects, as well as a large hard drive to move complete projects over to, as you will not need the increased speed that the SSD provides anymore.</p>
        <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>Machine learning benefits greatly from RAM and GPU. Machine learning models typically can be accelerated using NVIDIA's CUDA acceleration so having any NVIDIA GPU will greatly increase the time it takes to train a model. RAM is helpful if you
            have a larger dataset as it can hold more data in RAM at a time, increasing training time.</p>
